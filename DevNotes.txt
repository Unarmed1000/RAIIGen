Just some dev notes on features that might or might not be added in the future.

Vulkan
- Add VK_HEADER_VERSION information to the generated code
- Scan the documentation HTML and add it as doxygen comments in the generated code.
- For the 'array' allocations spawn two classes one that allocates one object and one that allocates a array.
- Some destructors require 'params' from the create struct, so detect that and add it as members to the RAII class.
- Autogenerate the error code to string classes.
- Generate 'convenience' methods by unrolling the 'create' struct. Hiding the 'standard' value params.
  These unrolled methods should be optional so add a DISABLE macro around them.
- Autogenerate the 'enumerate' methods.
- Finish the auto detection of 'member' candidates and add autogeneration code. These members should also be optional.  

All:
- Move the error code lookup back into a header file. So we are header only. 
  Any users can then do their own 'wrapper' hpp/cpp wrapper.
- Autogenerate the error code to string classes.
